## Introduction - Day 1





## Resources

I am always open to adding additional resources to these readme files as it is here as a learning tool.

My advice is to watch all of the below and hopefully you have also picked something up from the text and explanations above.

- [Cloud in 5 Minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M988_fsOSWo)
- [What is the Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzKFuHk8ovk)
- [Google Cloud Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbQc_8-rVt4)

If you made it this far, then you will know if this is where you want to be or not. See you on [Day 2](day02.md).
